# WooCommerce Export Orders SQL

Efficient SQL query for exporting typical order and line item data from WooCommerce

## Usage

Use your favorite SQL application such as [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com) or [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net) to execute this query against your WooCommerce database.

Many SQL clients can save the output in CSV format for easy reference or other possible usages.
